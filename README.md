# FlightServiceDemo
Final Project of CMPSC 174A @ UCSB

This is a flight service booking demo application that works with a SQLite database to generate reservations. While the actual application would be more complex (ie, have salted and cryptographic-secure passwords), this only serves as an example of how a reservation system might work.
